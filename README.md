Implementation of the Robocup gamecontroller heartbeat by Nao-Team HTWK. 
========================================================================

This is the implementation of the [Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/) gamecontroller heartbeat used by teams of the [Standard Platform League](http://www.tzi.de/spl/) during competition and training. It is published by [Nao-Team HTWK](http://naoteam.imn.htwk-leipzig.de) for all teams that are lacking the time to create their own implementation. It aims to make the referees job easier during competions and to let new teams focus on the more interesting problems of the competiton.

It is not designed to be a useful standalone application. You should include the source code into your own project and use it as a part of your own software. The file *replace-this-with-your-own-implementation.cpp* gives an example on the usage of the heartbeat implementation.

Questions, feedback, feature suggestions and bug reports are always welcome. Nao-Team HTWK.
